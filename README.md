All The Rage is a mobile rage room experience, where the facility is brought to the client's setting, relieving the owner of the company of needing a traditional "brick and mortar" storefront. This creates less overhead and greater profits. The site offers a range of packages and prices as well as merchandise for purchase.

The project was built with MERN stack (MongoDb, Express.js, React, and Node.js).
